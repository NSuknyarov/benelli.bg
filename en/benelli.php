		<h2>Benelli</h2>
		<p>
			Pure passion since 1911. Benelli is this and lots more: heritage, emotion and innovation become legendary throughout 100 years of 
			groundbreaking models, advanced technology, victories and world-renowned pilots.
		</p>
		<p>
			Elegant as well as sporting, Benelli motorcycles are created to meet the requirements of every rider, even of the most demanding,
			and ensure the ultimate riding experience and comfort while focusing on the consumption and respect for the natural environment.
			This is a challenge Benelli faces up to every day as the first aim of the whole group.
		</p>
		<p>
			A Benelli motorcycle has personality to spare and is immediately recognisable for its  engaging design and the 
			unmistakable sporty looks. The most innovative design concepts are implemented in all the models of the company of Pesaro 
			thanks to the expertise of its R&D centre, where many experts work together. In addition, Benelli counts on a widespread
			and efficient distribution network which covers all the national territory.
