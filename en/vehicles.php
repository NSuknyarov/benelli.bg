			Italian engineers and technicians. The Benelli quality system obtained TUV certification in compliance with the
			legislation UNI EN ISO 9001:2008. All main components must conform to a quality electronic control (DEA) system

			line where the engine is assembled into the frame, which, together with the other components, create the finished
