			<h4>Engine</h4>
			<p>
			A powerful inline three cylinder engine; a jewel of technology and performance, inspired directly by the world
			of competition. The engine, completely engineered by Italian technicians, offers superior performance in terms
			of maximum power, torque and unmistakable sound vs any other triple powered motorcycle available on the market today.
			To ensure smooth and optimal performance across the rev range, the electronic injection system uses a set of sensors
			which detect the necessary data to be processed by a micro-computer.  One of the many characteristics of the Benelli
			three-cylinder engine is the extractable gear box, which, as in every competition motorcycle, allows a rapid replacement
			of gears without having to disassemble the whole engine.

			<h4>Chassis</h4>
			<p>
			Benelli’s experience gained on tracks all over the world is concentrated in the design of its composite frames.
			The frame has been created by joining the front end, made in chrome molybdenum, to the rear end made in cast aluminium alloy.
			This joint is reinforced by structural gluing (as used in the aeronautical industry) to completely exclude the possibility of
			microscopic movements and minimise vibration transfer.

			<h4>Rail Seat</h4>
			<p>
			A distinctive sign of Benelli’s continuous technical innovation is the visible sub-frame in light weight cast aluminium,
			with a high surface finish. This solution was implemented for the first time by an Italian company in Europe.

			<h4>Swing Arm</h4>
			<p>
			The swing arm is constructed from a framework of steel alloy pipes, welded together with elements in micro-cast steel,
			which gives exceptional torsional rigidity combined with light weight.
